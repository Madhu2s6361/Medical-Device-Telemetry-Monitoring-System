# Medical-Device-Telemetry-Monitoring-System
This project simulates the behavior of a medical monitoring device, generating artificial Heart Rate (HR) and SpO₂ readings over time. It identifies abnormalities, plots trends, and logs alerts. This system showcases how real medical devices monitor vitals and trigger alerts — without using any hardware. 

## Features

--> Pure simulation of HR and SpO₂ values
--> Time-series generation for 120 samples
--> Automatic detection of abnormal HR and SpO₂
--> Console alert generation
--> Graphs for Heart Rate and SpO₂
--> Saves output as CSV and MAT files
--> Completely stand-alone (no hardware required)

## Concepts Used

--> Object-Oriented Programming (custom class)
--> Time-series data simulation
--> Alert threshold logic
--> Data validation and clamping
--> Plotting real-time trends
--> File saving (MAT + CSV)
--> Clean software design and modular coding

## Applications

--> Simulation of medical devices
--> Telemetry alert systems
--> Healthcare monitoring research
--> Real-time vital sign trend analysis
--> Biomedical software prototyping
