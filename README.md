# Medical-Device-Telemetry-Monitoring-System
This project simulates the behavior of a medical monitoring device, generating artificial Heart Rate (HR) and SpO₂ readings over time. It identifies abnormalities, plots trends, and logs alerts. This system showcases how real medical devices monitor vitals and trigger alerts — without using any hardware.
